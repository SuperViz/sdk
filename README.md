How to start coding with SuperViz? After installing this package, youâ€™ll need to [create an account](https://dashboard.superviz.com/) to retrieve a SuperViz Token and start coding.

## Quickstart

### 1. Installation

Install SuperViz SDK in your Node.js powered apps with the npm package:

```bash
npm install --save @superviz/sdk
```

Or, with yarn:

```bash
yarn add @superviz/sdk
```

### 2. Import the SDK

Once installed, import the SDK to your code:

```jsx
import SuperVizSdk from '@superviz/sdk';
```

### 3. Initialize the SDK

After importing the SDK, you can initialize passing your `DEVELOPER_KEY` as a parameter and the options object. You can see details for the options object on the [SDK Initialization page](https://docs.superviz.com/init/initialization).

The SuperViz SDK is your primary gateway to access all SDK features, offering the essential methods to add its components.

```jsx
async function initializeSuperVizSdk() {
  const sdk = await SuperVizSdk(DEVELOPER_KEY, {
    roomId: '<ROOM-ID>',
    group: {
      id: '<GROUP-ID>',
      name: '<GROUP-NAME>',
    },
    participant: {
      id: '<USER-ID>',
      name: '<USER-NAME>',
    },
  });

  return sdk;
}
```

### Documentation
